# Get Your Priorities Straight

**Indecisions can be challenging**, as figuring out the priorities of a project or task often feels overwhelming. By
using pair comparisons, this tool simplifies the process, clearing the foggy view and providing clarity in
decision-making.

**Get Your Priorities Straight** is a powerful yet simple tool designed to help you rank your priorities effectively.
Whether it's personal priorities like books to read, movies to watch, or professional tasks such as deciding on projects
or features to prioritize, this app guides you through the process of ranking them in a clear and systematic manner.

## How It Works

1. **Input Priorities**

   - List your priorities directly in the app.
   - Ensure a minimum of three items to begin ranking. Else, what's the point of ranking?

2. **Select a Ranking Method**

   - Choose one of the three comparison-based algorithms:
     - **Tournament**
     - **Merge Sort**
     - **Round-Robin**

3. **Ranking Process**

   - Compare items visually in pairs according to the selected method.
   - Keep choosing between options until the ranking is complete.

4. **View Results**
   - Get a neatly organized ranking of all your priorities.
   - Restart to re-prioritize with updated priorities or preferences.
